# VpApp
by Benjamin Tong

This is a simple React native app with GraphQL (Apollo) and React Navigation. It allows users to look up a Pokemon and its details.

## Instruction:

1. Run `npm install --save @types/classnames` to install all the dependencies

2. Install Android Studio and open an AVD for live update of the app.

3. Run `npm run android`

*PS: The app has not been ejected so prefer to run with expo.
